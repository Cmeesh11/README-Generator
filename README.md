# README Generator

## Description

As someone who creates many applications, a quality README file is essential to creating a well put together repository.
This README generator removes the redundancy of manually typing out every line in a markdown file.
Similar to how text editors offer autofill functionality (i.e. HTML skeletons), this README generator will do all of the hard work for you.

## Usage

This application can be run using the command line. Once you have downloaded the repository, navigate to the README-Generator directory and run  
```node index.js```.  

Answer the series of prompts displayed in the terminal. Once complete, a README.md file should be generated within the README-Generator directory.
